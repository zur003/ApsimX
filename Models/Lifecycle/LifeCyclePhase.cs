    /// # [Name]
    /// A LifeCyclePhase represents a distinct period in the development or an organisum.
    /// Each LifeCyclePhase assembles an arbitary number of cohorts which represent individuals
    /// that entered this phase at the same time and will have the same PhysiologicalAge.
    /// Each day the LifeCycle phase loops through each of its cohorts determining the increase 
    /// PhysiologicalAge, the number of mortalities in that cohort and the number of progeny the
    /// cohort produces.
    /// LifeCyclePhases are parameterised with three essential Properties:
    ///  1. Development.  Returns the change in Physiological Age (0-1) of each cohort each day,
    ///  2. Mortality. Returns the number of individuals that die in each cohort each day,
    ///  3. Reproduction. Returns the number of progeny that each cohort will produce each day.
    /// Each of these properties can be parameterised with any agregation of Ifunctions and
    /// the code takes the values from these IFunctions and adds or subtracts them from the
    /// corresponding property in each Cohort.
    /// The LifeCycle class calls the Process() method in each LifeCyclePhase and these then loop
    /// through each of their cohorts and apply the values of the Development, Mortality and Reproduction
    /// Functions in turn.  LifeCyclePhase has a CurrentCohort Property wihch is set at each loop 
    /// and may be referenced by functions to get cohort specific properties (eg Physiological age or Population)
    /// so Functions return different values for each cohort.
    /// When PhysiologicalAge of a cohort reaches 1 the members of this cohort graduate and a new
    /// of this many individuals in added to the next LifeCyclePhase and removed from the current 
    /// LifeCyclePhase.  If it is the final LifeCyclePhase the individuals of cohorts with 
    /// PhysiologicalAge of 1 will die and the cohort will be removed.
    /// Each LifeCyclePhase specifies a NameOfPhaseForProgeny and when Reproduciton returns a positive,
    /// a cohort of this many individuals is initiated in the corresponding LifeCyclePhaseForProgeny.
