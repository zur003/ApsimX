The contents of this website are generated by the hugo rendering engine (https://gohugo.io/). Hugo transforms the markdown files under the directory ApsimX/docs into a website.

To make a change to the website, modify or create new markdown files, commit the changes and create a pull request on github. When the pull request is merged, the website will be automatically updated.

Before creating a pull request however, it might be a good idea to preview the changes you've made to the website, to ensure they look the way you intend.

1. Download hugo from [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)

2. (Optional) add the hugo binary to PATH

    You will need to run hugo from a terminal. This is more convenient if the hugo binary is on PATH.

3. Open a terminal, navigate to ApsimX/docs, and run `hugo server`:

    ```
    cd /path/to/ApsimX/docs
    hugo server
    ```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to https://localhost:1313
